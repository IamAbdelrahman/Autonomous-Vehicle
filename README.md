# Autonomous-Vehicle

## Description:-
We chose this idea to overcome lists of difficulties that face the industries, workshops, and warehouses 
due to the process of moving packages by humans and even recording and monitoring the data related to these packages manually. 
So this project addresses increasing the productivity and efficiency of any warehouse
reducing human error and manual labor, optimizing the warehouse space, improving customer service
satisfying the employees, enhancing data accuracy and analysis, making the inventory under control
improving the workspace safety, reducing the stockout events, reducing handling and storage costs
decreasing shipping errors, reducing inventory loss, enhancing material handling coordination and finally improving the order of fulfillment accuracy.
